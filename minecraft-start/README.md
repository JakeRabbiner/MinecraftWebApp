# Welcome to React Three Minecraft

This project is just me trying to mimic Minecraft in React as well as further my understanding of computer graphics using new techniques. 

## How to play?

Currently it has 5 types of blocks: Grass, Wood, Log, Glass and Dirt.
You switch blocks with numbers 1-5 on your keyboard.
You navigate the world with the mouse and WASD.
You can click to add blocks and Alt+Click to remove blocks.
You world is stored in your browsers local storage.

## Want to extend, develop modify?

If you do so or just build a cool world. 

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install && npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
